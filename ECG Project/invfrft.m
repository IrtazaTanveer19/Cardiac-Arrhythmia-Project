%Usage: [x, t] = invfrft(X, f, fs)
%X : Complex vector representing the amplitude/phase of Fourier decomposition.
%f : Frequency vector corresponding to the Fourier decomposition
%where X(k) is a complex number, with |X(k)| and angle(X(k)) representing the
%amplitude and phase, respectively, of a sinusoid of frequency f(k) that makes up the desired time domain signal x(n).
%If N = length(x), f is a linearly spaced frequency vector of length ceil((N+1)/2) with each sample spaced fs/N Hz apart.
%x:  The desired time-domain signal corresponding to the Fourier
%coefficients
%t: The corresponding time vector for x, spaced linearly at 1/fs seconds
