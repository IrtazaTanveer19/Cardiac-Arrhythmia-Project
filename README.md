# EE100 Project
A GitHub repository containing my final project for EE100 (Introduction to Engineering Laboratory)

The project involved utilising MATLAB to investigate an ECG recording of a patient's heart to detect cardiac arrhythmias.

All of the code is located inside the folder titled "ECG Project". Simply download this folder and run the .mlx file on MATLAB. The Project Handout .pdf file has information about the aims of the project.
